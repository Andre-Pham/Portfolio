# Portfolio
This is an iOS app that tracks an investment portfolio, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Due to the price of the API used for retrieving holding prices, full functionality of the application has expired, however you may find demos (full and shortened) of the application's performance and features while the API subscription was active.

### Demos and Descriptions

Due to only GIFs being supported in READMEs, the demos below are choppy and sped up. Full demos can be found in the repository.
